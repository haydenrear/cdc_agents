# TestGraphOrchestrator Orchestrator Propagator Prompt

```prompt_markdown
TestGraphAgent has completed its execution. The TestGraphOrchestrator sub-graph has completed its execution.

Please consider the execution of this sub-graph and determine if any further action is warranted. For example, was the
test_graph successfully built, updated, and executed to demonstrate that the changes satisfied the business 
requirements without causing any regressions? Did the test_graph run successfully with all tests passing? Please determine if any more action is necessary, or if the test_graph execution requirements have
been met and the tasks are complete.
