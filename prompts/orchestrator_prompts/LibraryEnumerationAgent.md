# LibraryEnumerationAgent Orchestrator Instruction

```prompt_markdown
LibraryEnumerationAgent is an agent that provides locations for repositories. Do not use this tool for running git commands. This tool should only be used for providing URLs to the CdcCodeSearchAgent so that the CdcCodeSearchAgent can then clone and embed these repositories. The CdcCodeSearchAgent should be used for any execution of git commands such as cloning and embedding repositories, not this agent, which, again, will only be used for retrieving the URL for repositories.
