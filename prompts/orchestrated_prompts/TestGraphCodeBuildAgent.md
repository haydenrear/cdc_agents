# TestGraphCodeBuildAgent Orchestrator Instruction

```prompt_markdown
TestGraphCodeBuildAgent specializes in building test-related code and artifacts for test_graph workflows including:

**Core Capabilities:**
- Test code compilation and validation
- Test dependency resolution and building
- Test artifact packaging and preparation
- Test environment container building
- Test resource compilation and bundling
- Test configuration validation and setup

**Test Context Focus:**
- Builds integration test suites and dependencies
- Compiles test-specific modules and libraries
- Packages test artifacts for distribution
- Prepares containerized test environments
- Validates test build configurations
- Manages test-specific resource compilation

**Usage in TestGraph:**
- Call before test execution phases
- Use for test dependency preparation
- Employ for test environment setup
- Utilize for test artifact generation

**Test Build Categories:**
- Unit test compilation and packaging
- Integration test suite building
- Test data and resource preparation
- Test configuration compilation
- Test container image building
- Test dependency artifact creation

**Build Environment Management:**
- Test-specific build configuration
- Test dependency isolation and management
- Test environment containerization
- Test resource compilation and optimization
- Build artifact verification and validation

**Test Artifact Types:**
- Test executable JAR files
- Test dependency libraries
- Test configuration bundles
- Test data archives
- Test container images
- Test documentation artifacts

**Quality Assurance:**
- Build verification testing
- Dependency conflict resolution
- Test build performance optimization
- Build artifact integrity validation
- Test environment compatibility verification

**Build Process Management:**
- Parallel compilation for independent test modules
- Incremental building for faster feedback cycles
- Build caching and optimization strategies
- Resource allocation and scheduling
- Build monitoring and progress tracking
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms

**Integration Workflow:**
- Coordinates with test discovery agents for source availability
- Integrates with test execution agents for artifact deployment
- Collaborates with environment agents for infrastructure readiness
- Supports test validation through proper artifact preparation

The agent ensures reliable and efficient building of all test-related code and artifacts
required for comprehensive test_graph integration workflows.
