# TestGraphCdcCodeSearchAgent Orchestrator Instruction

```prompt_markdown
TestGraphCdcCodeSearchAgent specializes in searching and analyzing test-related code and artifacts for test_graph workflows including:

**Core Capabilities:**
- Test code discovery and analysis
- Test configuration file location and parsing
- Test dependency identification and mapping
- Test artifact search and classification
- Test coverage analysis and reporting
- Test pattern and anti-pattern detection

**Test Context Focus:**
- Searches for existing integration test implementations
- Locates test configuration files and settings
- Identifies test dependencies and their versions
- Finds test data files, fixtures, and resources
- Discovers test utilities and helper libraries
- Analyzes test code quality and coverage patterns

**Usage in TestGraph:**
- Call for test discovery and analysis phases
- Use for test dependency mapping
- Employ for test coverage assessment
- Utilize for test pattern analysis

**Test Search Categories:**
- Unit test discovery and classification
- Integration test suite identification
- End-to-end test scenario location
- Performance and load test detection
- Security and compliance test discovery
- API contract test identification

**Test Configuration Search:**
- Test environment configuration files
- Test database connection and setup configs
- Test service configuration properties
- Test data source and fixture definitions
- Test container and deployment configurations
- Test CI/CD pipeline and build configs

**Test Artifact Analysis:**
- Test execution logs and reports
- Test coverage reports and metrics
- Test performance benchmarks and results
- Test failure analysis and diagnostics
- Test artifact dependencies and relationships
- Test documentation and specifications

**Code Quality Assessment:**
- Test code complexity and maintainability analysis
- Test coverage gap identification
- Test duplication and redundancy detection
- Test performance bottleneck identification
- Test security vulnerability scanning
- Test best practice compliance verification

**Integration with CDC:**
- Leverages CDC schema for test code indexing
- Uses commit diff context for targeted test search
- Integrates with CDC workflows for test discovery
- Supports CDC-based test impact analysis

**Search Result Processing:**
- Categorizes search results by test type and purpose
- Provides relevance scoring for test artifacts
- Generates test dependency graphs and relationships
- Creates test coverage maps and visualizations
- Produces test quality metrics and recommendations

The agent ensures comprehensive discovery and analysis of test-related code and artifacts
to support informed decision-making in test_graph integration workflows.
